# Tic Tac Toe (JavaScript + HTML + CSS)

This is a simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game where you can play against an AI opponent. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to play optimally.

## ðŸ’» Features
- Classic 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board.
- Player vs AI (AI never loses).
- Visual feedback on game outcome (win/lose/tie).
- Replay button to start a new game.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (with Semantic UI for basic styling)
- JavaScript (vanilla)

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file with the game layout.
- `tic.css`: Stylesheet for board layout and game end messages.
- `tic.js`: JavaScript logic for game flow, AI, and rendering.

## â–¶ How to run
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click on any empty cell to make your move (you play as **O**).
3. The AI (playing as **X**) will respond.
4. When the game ends, a message will appear. Click **Replay** to play again.

## ðŸ¤– AI logic
- The AI uses the **minimax algorithm** to compute the best possible move.
- It will never lose â€” the best you can achieve is a tie if you play optimally.

- Add player vs player mode.
- Add difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard).
